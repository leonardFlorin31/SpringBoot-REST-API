Developed with Java, Maven for depencies, SpringBoot framework, Hibernate, PostgreSQL and Docker

This project is created using OOP and S.O.L.I.D. principles, includes integrated 
automated tests for the APIs and follows a clear separation arhitecture such as
a presentation layer, a service layer and a persistence layer.

Realised as a foundation for a bigger FullStack project I am currently working on.
